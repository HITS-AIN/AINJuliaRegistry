##  ‚Ñπ What is this?

A registry for simplifying the installation of Julia packages produced by AIN group.

Packages registered with the general registry of Julia will not be registered here too.

## <img width="27" height="17.5" src=smalljulia.png> Installing Julia

The easiest way of installing Julia is by downloading a binary file and simply uncompressing it in your folder of choice. Please see [here](https://julialang.org/downloads/) for platform specific instructions. Alternatively, one may choose to compile Julia from the source code.

## üî® Using the registry

To use this registry, enter package mode with ```]``` while in the Julia REPL and execute (you may prompted for your github credentials):

```
registry add https://github.com/HITS-AIN/AINJuliaRegistry
```

If used with a fresh installation of Julia, you may need to use the following line (see issue [here](https://forum.mimiframework.org/t/error-installing-mimi-under-v1-3-1/109/4)):

```
registry add https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General
```

## ‚áÆ Updating packages in AINJuliaRegistry

Switch into "package mode" with ```]``` and add type ```registry update AINJuliaRegistry```.

(You may prompted for your github credentials.)

This will make Julia update all packages associated with AINJuliaRegistry registry.

Alternatively, enter package mode and type ```up```. This will update all installed Julia packages, including the ones of this registry.

## üóë Removing the registry

To remove this registry simply use:

```
registry rm AINJuliaRegistry
```

#### ‚ùó Note to maintainers: remove package from registry 

Currently, this has to be done manually. 
Simply delete the directory that holds the relevant contents.
Also remove the corresponding line from file `Registry.toml`.
